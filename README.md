# Game of Life V1

## Overview

This is an older implementation of Conway's Game of Life. I developed this project. The game features a grid of cells that evolve based on a set of rules.

## Key Features

* Classic Game of Life simulation.
* Interactive cell activation/deactivation with mouse clicks.
* Manual step-by-step evolution using the Right Shift key.
* Automatic running of the simulation with the Enter key toggle.
* Uses Pygame for graphics and event handling.

## Prerequisites

Pygame needs to be installed.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Game of Life V1 repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FINN-2005/Game-Of-Life-V1.git
    cd Game-Of-Life-V1
    ```

2.  **Install Pygame-CE:**

    ```bash
    pip install pygame-ce
    ```

## How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project directory (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    cd Game-Of-Life-V1
    ```

2.  **Run the game:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Important Notes

* Press Enter to toggle between running and paused.
* Press Right Shift to go to the next iteration manually.
* Click the mouse to activate or deactivate cells.
